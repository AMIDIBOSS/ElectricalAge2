# shared

This is where all of the shared Integration code goes. If you find code here, it is here and not in core mainly because of one of three reasons:

* It has dependencies in the Minecraft or Forge classpath
* It is only ever going to be relevant to Minecraft
* It is not specific to any Minecraft version
